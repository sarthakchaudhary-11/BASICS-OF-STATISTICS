        "  Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics that cannot be measured numerically. This data can be divided into categories based on attributes or qualities.\n",

        "Answer3.) Dispersion refers to the spread or variability of a dataset. It indicates how much the data points differ from the central value (mean, median, or mode) and from each other. The higher the dispersion, the more spread out the values are; lower dispersion suggests that the values are closer to the central value. Dispersion is essential because it helps understand the distribution and consistency of data.\n",

        "1.Variance:\n",
        "Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It gives an idea of the overall spread of the data, with larger variances indicating that data points are more spread out from the mean. Variance is especially useful for comparing the variability of different datasets.\n",

        "Random sampling plays a critical role in making accurate and reliable inferences about populations in statistics. It is a method used to select a subset (sample) from a larger group (population) where each member has an equal chance of being chosen. This approach ensures that the sample is representative of the population, allowing researchers to draw conclusions and make predictions about the entire population based on the sample.\n",

        "\n",

        " *Methods such as confidence intervals (which provide a range of likely values for a population parameter) and hypothesis tests rely on the assumption that the sample was randomly selected.\n",
